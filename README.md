# General Intelligence Assessment

As a part of a job application process, I was asked to complete a [Thomas GIA test](https://www.thomas.co/assessments/general-intelligence-assessment-gia). As I haven't found any proper practice materials, I decided to create a simple web app to test myself before the real thing.

The app is available at [https://gia.steciuk.dev/](https://gia.steciuk.dev/).

- The app is still in development. Any parts of the app may change at any time. You may loose your results history.
